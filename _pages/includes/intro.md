I graduated from Electronic and Computer Engineering department in HongKong University ofScience and Technology (HKUST,香港科技大学) with a Ph.D degree in 2025 supervised by Prof. [Ross Murch](https://eermurch.home.ece.ust.hk/) (IEEE Fellow). Prior to my Ph.D. program, l received my B.E. from Huazhong University of Scienceand Technology (HUST,华中科技大学) with honours degree in 2021.

My work in Ph.D period is primarily focused on the integrated sensing and communicationsystem (**ISAC,通感一体化**) based on radio tomographic imaging(RTl,无线层析成像), which mainly includes improving the sensing performance of RTl with the existing resource in ISAC system. Recently, l'm enthusiastic about the combination of wireless communication system and reconfigurable antennas.

I will join Huawei's 2012 Wireless Technology Laboratory (华为2012无线技术实验室) soon.

I am updating my paper-sharing videos on RedNote (小红书). In these videos, I select interesting and important papers that I have read on wireless communication area and briefly introduce their most significant aspects in 5 to 8 minutes.
